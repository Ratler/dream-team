description: "Write a sequential execution spec from the current brainstorming session"

CRITICAL RULE: The spec file MUST be saved as specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>.md using today's date. For example, if today is 2026-02-07 and the topic is "user auth", save as specs/2026-02-07-user-auth.md. Never omit the date prefix.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/spec-sequential/SKILL.md` and follow its instructions exactly.
